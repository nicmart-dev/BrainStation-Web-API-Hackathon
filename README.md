A simple landing page that allows to show the weather and fetch a random cocktail name and image.
Done as part of BrainStation Web API hackaton over 4h as a team of 4 people, together with  @Yuxin Zeng, @Grace Lau, and @Lucas Deng

Using web APIs https://openweathermap.org/api and https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

# Special mentions
- Planned the work using Trello board: https://trello.com/b/lG8Y99Ib/web-api-hackathon
- Did a UI mockup collaboratively using https://excalidraw.com/#room=7a2d982dfb40189d705f,fAceWqTejbd0Rg601qPcxA

# Main learnings
- Using GitHub pull requests to better manage coding collaboratively, instead of manual merging on shared Google Drive
  
# Original requirements
For this hackathon event, your Education Team will divide the class into groups.
Your job is to build a front-end web application that fulfills the following requirements:
- Use HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox & Sass for structuring and building the UI
- Use appropriate BEM naming convention
- Use DOM APIs for adding/deleting/updating the elements on your page
- Use the fundamentals of programming in Javascript to write your logic. This would entail usage of variables, control flow statements, functions, loops & DOM APIs
- Demonstrate implementation of asynchronous programming concepts like promises, callbacks, event handlers
- Pick an API for your project and apply your asynchronous programming skills to call the required API in your project

# Main learnings
- Using GitHub pull requests to better manage coding collaboratively, instead of manual merging on shared Google Drive
  
# Original requirements
For this hackathon event, your Education Team will divide the class into groups.
Your job is to build a front-end web application that fulfills the following requirements:
- Use HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox & Sass for structuring and building the UI
- Use appropriate BEM naming convention
- Use DOM APIs for adding/deleting/updating the elements on your page
- Use the fundamentals of programming in Javascript to write your logic. This would entail usage of variables, control flow statements, functions, loops & DOM APIs
- Demonstrate implementation of asynchronous programming concepts like promises, callbacks, event handlers
- Pick an API for your project and apply your asynchronous programming skills to call the required API in your project

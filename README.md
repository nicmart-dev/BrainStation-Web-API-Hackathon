A simple landing page that allows to show the weather and fetch a random cocktail name and image.
Done as part of BrainStation Web API hackaton over 4h as a team of 4 people.

You can access the page at https://nicmart-dev.github.io/weather-mix/

# Credits
- Thanks to [Lucas Deng](https://github.com/littlexu87) for implementing the HTML5 and using DOM API to integrate the two web APIs output.
- Thanks to [Yuxin Zeng](https://github.com/speedemon-21) for implementing the weather API https://openweathermap.org/api
- Thanks to [Grace Lau](https://github.com/gracelau) for implementing the look and feel using SAAS and CSS3
- As for I, I implemented the cocktail API https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

# What we'll do better next time
- Using GitHub pull requests to better manage coding collaboratively, instead of manual merging on shared Google Drive
  
# Original requirements
For this hackathon event, your Education Team will divide the class into groups.
Your job is to build a front-end web application that fulfills the following requirements:
- Use HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox & Sass for structuring and building the UI
- Use appropriate BEM naming convention
- Use DOM APIs for adding/deleting/updating the elements on your page
- Use the fundamentals of programming in Javascript to write your logic. This would entail usage of variables, control flow statements, functions, loops & DOM APIs
- Demonstrate implementation of asynchronous programming concepts like promises, callbacks, event handlers
- Pick an API for your project and apply your asynchronous programming skills to call the required API in your project
